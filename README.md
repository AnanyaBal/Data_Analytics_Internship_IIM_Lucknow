# Data-Analytics
This repository has the projects that I worked on during my internship in 2017 under Prof. Sameer Mathur, IIM Lucknow. They are implemented in R.

The first one is to determine Prices of Economy and Premium seats in six different airlines and the second one is to determine hotel room prices in various Indian cities based on multiple facilities and factors. 

Both projects use the linear regression model to make predictions.

In the airline project, I have observed the data and stated some relations between different factors in the dataset (supported by t-tests) and I have created two regression models. 

In the Hotel Room project, I have done preliminary EDA with some plots, tested my hypothesess with t-tests and chi-square tests. The independants in the regression model were carefully selected on the basis of these tests.
